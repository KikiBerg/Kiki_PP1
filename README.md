Visit the deployed site: [Kiki codes](https://kikiberg.github.io/Kikicodes/)

This page is my first student project. 
Hopefully it will work as a placeholder while I'm developing my portfolio site.

## User Experience (UX)

I wanted to create an online portfolio about myself.

### User Stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals

* I want to make it interesting enough for possible future employers to see.
* I want the site to be responsive for different device sizes.
* I want the site to be easy to navigate.

#### Returning and frequent Visitor Goals

* I want to be able to see updates (news page) about Kiki's fulfillments.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

As I make use of background images for 3 out of 4 pages, I wanted to keep the colour scheme used on the site coherent and 
straightforward so as to not overwhelm users. Green and yellow are typical colours we associate with nature and outdoors and as I wanted to present myself and my interests I used relevant colors.

* I have used `#FFFCC9` & `#40513B` as the primary and secondary colours used for the sites text.
* I have used `#FFFEF7` as the overlay used over the sites background image.
* I have used `#FFFBAC` for the header.
* I have used `#40513B` for the footer.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

I have used the google font [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?query=open+sans). The reasons I chose this one is:
* its clean and modern sans-serif typeface.
* it is comprehensible in both small and huge sizes.
* it is simple and makes the content easily readable.

### Imagery

As the website is called Kiki codes, I wanted to make the coding theme stand out by using icons related to coding.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using balsamiq.

![Home Page](documentation/wireframes/homewireframe.webp)
![About Page](documentation/wireframes/difficultywireframe.webp)
![Photos Page](documentation/wireframes/gamewireframe.webp)
![Contact Page](documentation/wireframes/highscorewireframe.webp)

### Features

The website is comprised of a home page, an about page, a photos page & a contact page.

All Pages on the website are responsive and have:

* A favicon in the browser tab.

![favicon](documentation/Kiki_codes_favicon.png)

* The title of the site at the top of every page. This title also acts as a link back to the home page.
![The Kiki codes Title](documentation/Kiki_codes_Banner.png)

* Every page will display as dotted and underlined when there is a hovering. This feature is available only on larger devices.

#### The Home Page

The home page of Kiki codes displays the site's name as a title, an image in the background and then a container which holds some Hi text.

#### The About Page

The about page displays the sites name as a title. There are two sections ............

![About page image](documentation/Kiki_codes_Banner_About_page.webp)

#### The Photos Page

The photos page displays the sites name as a title............

![Photos Page image](documentation/Kiki_codes_Banner_Photos_page.webp)

#### The Contact Page

The contact page displays the sites name as a title............

![Contact page image](documentation/Kiki_codes_Banner_Contact_page.webp)

#### Future Implementations

In future implementations I would like to:

1. Add one more page that will include any updates and news about Kiki's fulfillments.
2. Look further into the accessibility for people with colour blindness, perhaps by adding more symbols for checking or hovering.

### Accessibility

I have tried during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML, like section, nav, main, header, footer elements.
* Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.
* Choosing a sans serif font for the site - these fonts are suitable for people with dyslexia.
* I looked into red/green colour blindness. I used the chrome extension [Web Disability Simulator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-disability-simulator/olioanlbgbpmdlgjnnampnnlohigkjla) to be able to see what someone with red/green colour blindness would see.
